# Iris Recognition System

This project is an iris recognition system ([*See original project.*](https://github.com/andreibercu/iris-recognition)) to analyze and recognize iris images. It includes functionality for feature extraction, comparison of iris features, and performance improvements for various scenarios, including suboptimal camera conditions. The project has been updated to run on Python 3.9.x and includes functionality to save iris data to a database. There are also plans to develop a dynamic system with a GUI or mobile app for real-time use.

## Planned Features
- [ ] **Improved Iris Analysis**: Improved extraction of features from iris images and creating a dictionary for recognition.
- [ ] **Iris Comparison in Real-Time**: Comparing extracted iris features to recognize individuals in real-time.
- [ ] **Performance Improvements**: Enhancements for recognition performance and speed, especially under suboptimal camera conditions.
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Save and retrieve iris data using a database.
- [ ] **Future Development**: Plans to create a GUI or mobile app for dynamic use.
